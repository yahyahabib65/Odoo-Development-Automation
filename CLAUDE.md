# Odoo Module Automation

## Project Status
- Phase: Roadmap rebuilt — ready for `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
- Directory: /home/inshal-rauf/Odoo_module_automation
- Remote: git@github.com:Inshal5Rauf1/Odoo-Development-Automation.git
- Architecture: **GSD extension** (not standalone CLI)
- Roadmap: 9 phases, 68 Odoo-specific requirements + 13 GSD-inherited

## Architecture

```
Layer 1: GSD Orchestration (INHERITED)
  Context management, state, phases, agents, checkpoints, git

Layer 2: Odoo Extension (WE BUILD)
  Agents, workflows, commands, templates, knowledge base

Layer 3: Python Utilities (WE BUILD)
  Jinja2 rendering, pylint-odoo, Docker validation, ChromaDB search

Layer 4: AI Coding Assistant (USER'S ENVIRONMENT)
  Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode — GSD + odoo-gen installed
```

## Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| GSD extension (not standalone CLI) | GSD provides orchestration, context, hallucination prevention | Decided |
| Depend on GSD (not fork) | Benefit from GSD updates, avoid divergence | Decided |
| Clone-based install (~/.claude/) | Same pattern as GSD, works with any AI coding assistant | Decided |
| Odoo 17.0 primary target | Stable, widely adopted, strong OCA support | Decided |
| Fork-and-extend strategy | Leverage existing OCA/GitHub modules as foundation | Decided |
| Semantic search (ChromaDB + sentence-transformers) | Intent-based matching, not just keywords | Decided |
| Python 3.12 for utilities | Odoo 17 supports 3.10-3.12 only; 3.13+ breaks validation | Decided |
| Checkpoint-based human review | GSD provides mechanism; we wire Odoo checkpoints | Decided |
| OCA quality as the bar | pylint-odoo, i18n, full security, tests | Decided |
| Docker for validation | Only way to truly verify module installs and tests pass | Decided |
| UI UX Pro Max Skill pattern | Reasoning engine + hierarchical system + rule library for skill architecture | Decided |

## Prior Art
| Project | Role | Use |
|---------|------|-----|
| **GSD** | INHERIT | Full orchestration layer |
| **erp_claude** | ADOPT KNOWLEDGE | Odoo 17 model/view skills → knowledge base |
| **UI UX Pro Max Skill** | ADOPT PATTERN | Reasoning engine, hierarchical system, rule library |
| **Ralph** | REFERENCE | Fresh context loop, confirms GSD approach |
| **Cognee** | REFERENCE | Knowledge graph pipeline for KB design |
| **LangExtract** | REFERENCE | Source-grounded extraction for spec parsing |
| **Agent Lightning** | FUTURE | RL agent optimization → v2+ |
| **Gemini-Odoo-Module-Generator** | COMPETITOR | Baseline we must exceed |
| **Ruflo** | SKIP | Over-engineered (60+ agents, Byzantine consensus) |
| **LobeHub** | SKIP | Web chat platform, different product |

## Mistakes Log
<!-- Track mistakes made during development to avoid repeating them -->

1. **Built standalone CLI plans before confirming architecture** — Spent time planning Typer CLI, custom config, custom state management when the actual vision was a GSD extension. Wasted Phase 1 planning cycle. Lesson: confirm the product form factor FIRST.
2. **Assumed sentence-transformers was required for ChromaDB** — Included ~200MB sentence-transformers + torch as dependencies when ChromaDB ships its own 22MB ONNX embedding model. Discovered in Phase 10; removed both deps. Lesson: verify what a library actually uses before adding its transitive deps.
3. **Mocked Docker tests gave false confidence** — Original `test_docker_runner.py` mocked `_run_compose()` which hid two real bugs: (a) `exec` causes race condition with entrypoint server on same DB, and (b) log parser regex didn't match Odoo 17's actual test output format (`Starting ClassName.test_method ...` not `test_method ... ok`). Only discovered when Phase 11 added unmocked live Docker tests. Lesson: mocked tests validate logic, not integration — always add real integration tests for Docker/container workflows.
4. **Docker `exec` into running Odoo container causes serialization failures** — Two Odoo processes (entrypoint server + exec'd process) write to the same PostgreSQL database simultaneously, causing `psycopg2.errors.SerializationFailure`. Fix: use `docker compose run --rm` (fresh container, no entrypoint server) and `--test-tags` to filter only target module tests. Lesson: `exec` into a service container means TWO processes share the same DB.
5. **`--test-enable` runs ALL module tests, not just the target** — Without `--test-tags={module}`, Odoo runs tests for base + all dependencies (938 tests for a simple module). This takes 30+ seconds and is fragile. Lesson: always use `--test-tags` when running Odoo tests in Docker.
6. **Planner agent sometimes produces no output on first invocation** — During Phase 11 planning, the planner agent ran 29 tool uses (49k tokens) but created no PLAN.md files. Required resuming the agent. Lesson: always spot-check that plan files exist after planner returns; be prepared to resume.
7. **AskUserQuestion tool silently drops selections** — During Phase 11 discussion, multi-select questions returned empty answers (".") even though user made selections. Workaround: re-ask questions individually. Lesson: if AskUserQuestion returns empty, re-ask — don't assume user skipped.

## Lessons Learned

- Multi-agent systems fail 41-86.7% of the time in production, mostly from coordination issues
- Fork-and-extend becomes worse than scratch when >40% of module is modified
- Docker validation gives false confidence (tests run as admin, empty DB, missing cross-module interactions)
- GitHub code search API: 10 req/min, 1000 result cap — need local index strategy
- GSD provides ~19% of requirements for free (orchestration, context, checkpoints, state)
- 81% of requirements are pure Odoo domain work — no generic framework can provide them

## Commands

All commands are invoked as `/odoo-gen:<command>` through the AI coding assistant.

| Command | Description | Phase |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `new` | Scaffold a new Odoo module from natural language description | 1 |
| `validate` | Run pylint-odoo + Docker validation on a module | 3 |
| `search` | Semantically search GitHub/OCA for similar modules | 8 |
| `research` | Research Odoo patterns and existing solutions for a need | 2 |
| `plan` | Plan module architecture before generation | 4 |
| `phases` | Show generation phases and progress for current module | 1 |
| `config` | View/edit Odoo-specific settings (wraps GSD config) | 1 |
| `status` | Show current module generation status (wraps GSD status) | 1 |
| `resume` | Resume interrupted module generation (wraps GSD resume) | 1 |
| `index` | Build/update local ChromaDB index of Odoo modules | 8 |
| `extend` | Fork and extend an existing module | 8 |
| `history` | Show generation history and past modules | 7 |
| `help` | Show available commands and usage | 1 |

**Wrapper commands** (`config`, `status`, `resume`): These provide Odoo-specific context on top of GSD equivalents. Users interact with `/odoo-gen:status` (not bare `/gsd:progress`), keeping the experience unified within the Odoo domain.

## Development Notes
- Git initialized locally, remote is empty
- Greenfield project — no existing code
- Config: interactive mode, comprehensive depth, parallel execution, quality model profile (Opus)
- gh CLI not authenticated — need `gh auth login` for GitHub API access
- GSD must be installed before odoo-gen can work
- Old Phase 1 plans (standalone CLI) deleted — they were for wrong architecture
