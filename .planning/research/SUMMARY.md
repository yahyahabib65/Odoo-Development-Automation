# Project Research Summary

**Project:** Odoo Module Automation (odoo-gen)
**Domain:** GSD extension for automated Odoo 17.0 module code generation
**Researched:** 2026-03-01
**Revised:** 2026-03-01 (architecture pivot to GSD extension)
**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

## Architecture Update (2026-03-01)

**IMPORTANT:** This research was originally conducted for a standalone Python CLI tool. The architecture has since pivoted to a GSD (Get Shit Done) extension. Key changes:

- **No standalone CLI**: GSD provides the command system, state, checkpoints, agent spawning
- **No Typer/Rich**: GSD + AI coding assistant handles the interface
- **No custom orchestration**: GSD's wave-based execution replaces asyncio subprocess management
- **Python utilities still needed**: Jinja2 rendering, pylint-odoo, Docker validation, ChromaDB search
- **New prior art**: 7 additional repos analyzed (see PRIOR_ART.md)

The stack recommendations, feature analysis, architecture patterns, and pitfalls remain valid — they inform what we build ON TOP OF GSD. The "how we build" changed; the "what we build" for Odoo is the same.

## Executive Summary

This project is a GSD extension that specializes the GSD orchestration framework for automated Odoo 17.0 module development. GSD provides the orchestration layer (context management, state persistence, hallucination prevention, checkpoint coordination, agent spawning). We build Odoo-specific agents, knowledge base, validation tools, and generation workflows on top.

The original research identified that heavyweight frameworks like CrewAI and LangGraph are the wrong abstraction for CLI-based AI agents. GSD validates this finding — it is a lightweight orchestration layer that coordinates AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode) through markdown-based state and fresh context windows per task, not through complex API-based agent frameworks.

The critical constraint remains Odoo 17's Python version lock: 3.10-3.12 only. Python 3.13+ will silently break Odoo validation. Python utilities (template rendering, validation, search) must use Python 3.12.

The top risks remain: (1) Odoo version confusion in generated code, (2) the "god agent" anti-pattern, (3) Docker validation false confidence, and (4) context window overflow. GSD directly mitigates risk #4 (fresh context per agent). The other three require Odoo-specific solutions built in our extension.

## Key Findings

### Recommended Stack

The stack is split into two layers: GSD extension (inherited, not built) and Python utilities (built by us).

**Layer 1: GSD Extension (INHERITED)**
- **GSD framework** -- Orchestration, context management, state, checkpoints, agent spawning
- **AI coding assistant** -- Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode (user's choice)
- **Markdown-based state** -- .planning/ directory structure, STATE.md, PLAN.md, config.json

**Layer 2: Python Utilities (WE BUILD)**
- **Python 3.12** -- Runtime. Maximum Odoo 17 supported version. 3.13+ breaks Odoo.
- **uv** -- Package/project manager. 10-100x faster than pip/poetry.
- **Pydantic** -- Data validation. Type-safe module specs.
- **Jinja2** -- Code templating. Module scaffolding with template inheritance.
- **sentence-transformers + ChromaDB** -- Local semantic search (Phase 8). Offline, free.
- **PyGithub** -- GitHub API access for module discovery (Phase 8).
- **Docker SDK + pylint-odoo** -- Validation pipeline (Phase 3). Real Odoo 17 installation testing.
- **Ruff** -- Linter + formatter for generated Python code.

**Removed from stack (provided by GSD):**
- ~~Typer + Rich~~ -- GSD command system + AI assistant UI
- ~~asyncio subprocess orchestration~~ -- GSD agent spawning
- ~~Custom state management~~ -- GSD STATE.md
- ~~pydantic-settings[toml]~~ -- GSD config.json
- **Jinja2** -- Code templating. Module scaffolding with template inheritance.
- **Ruff** -- Linter + formatter. Replaces Flake8+Black+isort. 150x faster.

**Critical version constraint:** `requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"`. This is non-negotiable.

**Dependency warning:** sentence-transformers pulls PyTorch (~2GB). Offer CPU-only install and pre-built embedding index as alternatives.

### Expected Features

**Must have (table stakes -- P1):**
- Natural language input with structured follow-up questions -- the entry point to the tool
- Complete module file generation (models, views, security, manifest, tests) with real content, not stubs
- Security layer generation (ACLs + record rules + group hierarchy) -- the most commonly botched part of Odoo modules
- OCA quality compliance via pylint-odoo -- automated quality gate
- Human review checkpoints after each generation stage -- essential for trust in ERP code
- Docker-based validation (install + test execution) -- the only reliable proof a module works
- Test generation with actual assertions (TransactionCase, access rights tests)
- CLI interface with rich terminal output

**Should have (differentiators -- P2):**
- Semantic search of GitHub/OCA repositories -- the "search-first" core differentiator
- Fork-and-extend workflow -- adapt existing modules instead of rebuilding from scratch
- Multi-agent specialization -- different agents for models, views, security, tests
- Incremental diff review at each generation stage
- Manifest dependency resolution -- auto-detect correct module dependencies

**Defer (v2+):**
- Module adaptation intelligence (deep Odoo ORM understanding for fork modification)
- Actionable validation feedback (parsing Odoo logs to diagnose failures)
- CE/EE edition awareness
- Odoo 18.0 support -- only after 17.0 pipeline is proven solid

**Anti-features (explicitly avoid):**
- Web UI (developers live in terminals; adds months of scope for marginal UX gain)
- Autonomous production deployment (ERP modules affect live business data; human deploys)
- Multi-version support in v1 (version blindness is the #1 AI code generation flaw per Odoo Experience 2025)
- Full business logic generation without review (silent failures in ERP are the worst outcome)

### Architecture Approach

The system is a five-layer architecture: CLI (user interface), Orchestration (pipeline control + state + checkpoints), Agent Execution (adapter pattern wrapping each AI CLI tool), Search/Retrieval (semantic module matching), and Validation (Docker + linting). The pipeline is sequential with checkpoint gates -- models must exist before views, views before security, everything before tests. Each generation task uses a maker-checker loop (one agent generates, another validates, max 3 iterations). State is persisted after every stage for crash recovery and resume capability.

**Major components:**
1. **Pipeline Controller** -- orchestrates the sequential generation flow with stage transitions and checkpoint gates
2. **Agent Adapters** -- uniform interface wrapping Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI as interchangeable subprocesses
3. **Interactive Questioner** -- LLM-powered requirement gathering with Odoo-specific follow-up questions
4. **Search Engine** -- GitHub/OCA API search + embedding-based semantic re-ranking with version/quality filtering
5. **Generator Tasks** -- per-file-type code generation (models, views, security, logic, tests, i18n) with Odoo domain prompts
6. **Validation Pipeline** -- pylint-odoo + Docker install + test execution as the quality gate
7. **State Manager** -- persistent pipeline state for resumability; immutable state transitions

**Key patterns:**
- Sequential pipeline with checkpoint gates (not parallel, due to file dependencies)
- Adapter pattern for multi-LLM support (swap agents without pipeline changes)
- Maker-checker loops for quality (generator + reviewer agent per task)
- Persistent state for resumability (JSON files, `odoo-gen resume` command)
- Two-path decision router (fork-and-extend vs. build-from-scratch based on search results)

### Critical Pitfalls

1. **Odoo version confusion** -- LLMs mix v8-v18 patterns. Generated code uses deprecated `@api.multi`, `_columns`, or `openerp` imports. Prevention: version-pinned pylint-odoo on every output, Odoo 17 API examples in every agent prompt, version canary tests. Address in Phase 1.

2. **God agent anti-pattern** -- Single agent generating all files produces inconsistent cross-references (views referencing non-existent fields, security ACLs with wrong model names). 79% of multi-agent system failures originate from specification/coordination issues. Prevention: single-responsibility agents with strict input/output contracts, no prompt exceeding 6K tokens. Address in Phase 3.

3. **Security as afterthought** -- ACLs generated after models create mismatches. Missing record rules, wrong model references, flat group hierarchies. The most common "looks done but isn't" failure. Prevention: generate security IN PARALLEL with models, automated cross-reference validation. Address in Phase 3.

4. **Docker validation false confidence** -- Tests pass against empty database with admin user. Module breaks in production with existing data, restricted users, other modules installed. Prevention: install common base modules (sale, purchase, account), test as non-admin user, seed demo data. Address in Phase 2.

5. **Context window overflow** -- Module context grows beyond effective attention. Field names become inconsistent across files. "Lost in the middle" phenomenon degrades output silently. Prevention: pass schema references not full code, cap agent context at 50% of window, cross-file consistency checks. Address in Phase 3.

6. **Search returning noise** -- GitHub API limitations (10 req/min code search, 1000 result cap). OCA module descriptions are vague. Wrong-version modules appear as top results. Prevention: filter by Odoo version first, check maintenance signals, prefer OCA repos, pre-index locally. Address in Phase 4.

7. **Fork-and-extend producing unmaintainable code** -- AI rewrites core methods instead of using Odoo inheritance (`_inherit`, xpath). Merge conflicts with upstream become impossible. Prevention: 40% modification threshold (exceed it = build from scratch), enforce inheritance patterns, track fork divergence. Address in Phase 4.

## Implications for Roadmap (SUPERSEDED — see .planning/ROADMAP.md for current 9-phase plan)

> **WARNING:** The 5-phase plan below was written for the standalone CLI architecture. It has been SUPERSEDED by the 9-phase GSD-extension roadmap in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`. The domain insights (pitfalls, dependencies, research flags) are still valid but the phase structure and stack references (Typer, Rich) are outdated.

Based on combined research, here is the suggested phase structure. The ordering is driven by three principles: (1) dependencies (you cannot validate what you have not generated), (2) risk front-loading (tackle the hardest unknowns early), and (3) incremental value delivery (each phase produces a usable artifact).

### Phase 1: Foundation (CLI + Scaffold + Configuration)

**Rationale:** Everything depends on the CLI skeleton, configuration system, and project structure. Building this first establishes the frame that all subsequent phases plug into.
**Delivers:** `odoo-gen` CLI with `new`, `validate`, `resume` commands. Jinja2 templates for Odoo 17.0 module structure. Configuration system (TOML-based). Pipeline state management (JSON persistence). Project scaffolding that creates valid but empty Odoo modules.
**Addresses features:** CLI interface, basic module scaffolding
**Avoids pitfalls:** Odoo version confusion (version-pinned templates from day one), API key exposure (environment/keychain only), CLI UX failures (progress feedback, interactive mode)
**Stack elements:** Python 3.12, uv, Typer, Rich, Pydantic, Jinja2, Ruff, mypy, pre-commit

### Phase 2: Validation Pipeline

**Rationale:** Build the quality gate BEFORE building the code generator. Without validation, you cannot verify that generation works. This also front-loads Docker infrastructure risk.
**Delivers:** `odoo-gen validate <module_path>` command. Docker manager (container lifecycle via Docker SDK). pylint-odoo integration with `--valid-odoo-versions=17.0`. Odoo install + test runner. Quality scoring and reporting. Realistic test environment (common modules installed, demo data, non-admin user).
**Addresses features:** Docker-based validation, OCA quality compliance
**Avoids pitfalls:** Docker validation false confidence (realistic environment from the start), version confusion (pylint-odoo catches wrong-version patterns)
**Stack elements:** Docker SDK, pylint-odoo, pytest, pytest-docker

### Phase 3: Single-Agent Generation Pipeline

**Rationale:** Deliver the core value proposition with minimal complexity. Start with one agent (Claude Code, the strongest general coder) to prove the generation pipeline end-to-end. This is where the highest technical risk lies (prompt engineering, cross-file consistency) and must be tackled before adding multi-agent complexity.
**Delivers:** End-to-end module generation from natural language input. Interactive questioner for requirement gathering. Sequential generation (models -> views -> security -> logic -> tests -> i18n). Human checkpoint system with approval/rejection. Maker-checker loop (generate + validate per stage). Single agent adapter (Claude Code).
**Addresses features:** Natural language input, complete module generation, security layer generation, test generation, human review checkpoints
**Avoids pitfalls:** God agent (decompose into per-file-type tasks even with single agent), security afterthought (generate security alongside models), context overflow (schema-based context, not full code), version confusion (Odoo 17 examples in every prompt)
**Stack elements:** Pydantic-AI, asyncio, Jinja2 templates, agent adapter pattern
**Research flag:** NEEDS DEEPER RESEARCH. Prompt engineering for Odoo module components (models vs views vs security) requires iterative experimentation. Agent subprocess I/O behavior for Claude Code needs a spike.

### Phase 4: Search and Retrieval

**Rationale:** The "search-first" strategy is the project's core differentiator, but it is an enhancement to generation, not a prerequisite. You can generate modules without search; search makes them better. Building it after the generation pipeline means the fork-and-extend path has a proven from-scratch path to fall back on.
**Delivers:** `odoo-gen search <description>` command. GitHub/OCA repository search. Embedding index for semantic module matching. Decision router (fork vs. scratch, 0.7 threshold). Fork-and-extend handler with Odoo inheritance patterns. Curated index of top 200 OCA modules for Odoo 17.0.
**Addresses features:** Semantic search, fork-and-extend workflow, manifest dependency resolution
**Avoids pitfalls:** Search noise (version filter first, quality thresholds, prefer OCA), Frankenstein forks (40% modification cap, enforce inheritance, track divergence)
**Stack elements:** sentence-transformers, ChromaDB, PyGithub
**Research flag:** NEEDS DEEPER RESEARCH. OCA repo structure and manifest parsing need investigation. Embedding effectiveness on Odoo module descriptions needs benchmarking. GitHub API rate limits need workaround strategy.

### Phase 5: Multi-Agent + Quality Loops

**Rationale:** Adding multiple LLM agents requires a stable pipeline to enhance. This phase improves output quality through agent specialization and competition, not by changing the pipeline structure.
**Delivers:** Additional agent adapters (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI). Agent routing (best agent per task type). Maker-checker loops across different agents (one generates, another reviews). Fallback chains (if preferred agent fails, try next). Parallel execution for independent tasks.
**Addresses features:** Multi-agent specialization, incremental diff review
**Avoids pitfalls:** God agent (specialized agents with bounded prompts), tight coupling to single LLM (adapter pattern)
**Stack elements:** asyncio parallel execution, additional agent adapters
**Research flag:** NEEDS SPIKE. Each CLI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) has different subprocess I/O behavior. Routing heuristics (which agent for which task) need empirical testing.

### Phase Ordering Rationale

- **Foundation before everything** because CLI, state management, and configuration are dependencies for every other component.
- **Validation before generation** because without validation you cannot verify generated code works. Building validation early means every subsequent phase can be tested against real Odoo 17.0.
- **Single-agent generation before search** because the from-scratch pipeline is simpler, delivers core value, and provides a fallback for the fork-and-extend path. Generation is the core promise; search is the differentiator.
- **Search after generation** because search enhances generation quality but does not enable it. A working from-scratch pipeline must exist before fork-and-extend can be built.
- **Multi-agent last** because orchestrating multiple LLMs is the highest-complexity, lowest-urgency enhancement. The pipeline must be stable before adding this dimension.
- **Human checkpoints woven into Phase 3** (not a separate phase) because they are integral to the generation flow, not a bolt-on feature.

### Research Flags

Phases likely needing deeper research during planning:
- **Phase 3 (Single-Agent Generation):** Prompt engineering for Odoo module components is iterative and domain-specific. Need to research effective few-shot examples, context structures, and Odoo 17 API patterns for each file type (models, views, security, wizards). Agent subprocess I/O behavior for Claude Code needs a spike.
- **Phase 4 (Search and Retrieval):** OCA repository structure is not well-documented for automated parsing. Need to research manifest schema, README conventions, and effective embedding strategies for code module descriptions. GitHub API rate limits need workaround design.
- **Phase 5 (Multi-Agent):** Agent routing heuristics (which LLM is best for which Odoo task) need empirical benchmarking. Subprocess I/O differs across agents.

Phases with standard patterns (skip research-phase):
- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** CLI frameworks, configuration, project structure are well-documented. Typer, Pydantic, Jinja2 have excellent docs.
- **Phase 2 (Validation):** Docker-based testing and pylint-odoo integration are well-documented by Odoo and OCA. Standard patterns apply.

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Stack | HIGH | All versions verified via PyPI and official docs. Python 3.12 constraint is firm and verified against Odoo 17 Docker image. Every library supports 3.12. |
| Features | MEDIUM | Table stakes are clear from competitor analysis and Odoo Experience 2025 talks. Differentiator value (search-first, fork-and-extend) is logical but unproven in this specific domain. Anti-features are well-reasoned. |
| Architecture | MEDIUM | Subprocess-adapter pattern validated by multiple OSS projects. Sequential pipeline with checkpoints is standard. The specific combination (multi-LLM + semantic search + Odoo domain + fork-and-extend) is novel enough that integration patterns need validation. |
| Pitfalls | MEDIUM-HIGH | Odoo version confusion, security afterthought, and Docker false confidence are well-documented by OCA and Odoo Experience talks. God agent and context overflow are supported by peer-reviewed research. Fork divergence risks come from ICSE 2020 paper. |

**Overall confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

### Gaps to Address

- **Agent subprocess behavior:** How exactly do Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI differ in subprocess I/O (stdin prompts, stdout format, exit codes, error handling)? Need a practical spike before Phase 3.
- **OCA repo indexing:** How are OCA repos organized? What metadata is in each `__manifest__.py`? How many Odoo 17.0 modules exist across OCA? Need to crawl and analyze before Phase 4.
- **Embedding effectiveness on Odoo descriptions:** How well does all-MiniLM-L6-v2 perform on short module descriptions and README content? Need benchmarking with real OCA modules before Phase 4.
- **Prompt engineering for Odoo:** What prompting patterns produce the best Odoo model/view/security code? This is iterative and will need continuous research during Phase 3.
- **Token cost per module:** With unconstrained API budget, still worth understanding cost to set expectations. Maker-checker loops could mean 12-48 API calls per module.
- **CE vs EE structural differences:** How do Community and Enterprise edition modules differ? Impacts template design if EE support is added later.
