# Requirements: Odoo Module Automation v3.0

**Defined:** 2026-03-05
**Core Value:** Compress months of repetitive Odoo module development into days by extending GSD's orchestration with Odoo-specialized agents, knowledge, and validation.

## v3.0 Requirements

### Auto-Fix Pipeline (AST Migration)

- [ ] **AFIX-01**: Auto-fix functions use AST-based source modification instead of regex for all 5 pylint fixers (_fix_w8113, _fix_w8111, _fix_c8116, _fix_w8150, _fix_c8107), handling multi-line expressions correctly
- [ ] **AFIX-02**: Unused import detection scans full AST body for name references instead of 4-name whitelist, removing any import with zero references in file body

### Template Correctness

- [ ] **TMPL-01**: mail.thread injection respects per-model chatter flag (default true for top-level business models, false for config tables, line items, wizards, and models extending parents with mail.thread)
- [ ] **TMPL-02**: Wizard template conditionally imports api only when @api decorators are used in generated wizard methods
- [ ] **TMPL-03**: Wizard TransientModels receive ACL entries in ir.model.access.csv alongside regular models
- [ ] **TMPL-04**: Test template uses display_name assertion instead of deprecated name_get() method, with version gate for Odoo 18.0 compatibility

### Validation Infrastructure

- [ ] **VALD-01**: docker_install_module uses `docker compose run --rm` instead of `docker compose exec`, eliminating serialization race condition
- [ ] **VALD-02**: Validation pipeline uses unified Result[T] type with success/data/errors fields across auto_fix, docker_runner, pylint_runner, and verifier modules

### Search Infrastructure

- [ ] **SRCH-01**: GitHub API calls in index builder check X-RateLimit-Remaining header, sleep until reset when low, and retry with exponential backoff on 403/429 responses
- [ ] **SRCH-02**: AST analyzer detects _inherit-only model extensions (models with _inherit but no _name) and records them in ModuleAnalysis.inherited_models

### Code Quality

- [ ] **QUAL-01**: CLI defers heavy imports (chromadb, PyGithub, gitpython, Docker, validation stack) inside command functions, keeping module-level imports to click and stdlib only
- [ ] **QUAL-02**: render_module decomposed from 371-line monolith into independently testable stage functions (render_manifest, render_models, render_views, render_security, render_wizards, render_tests, render_static)
- [ ] **QUAL-03**: Docker compose file path resolved via importlib.resources or configuration instead of 5-level parent directory traversal

## v3.1 Requirements (Deferred)

### Design Flaws — Feature Gaps

24 confirmed design flaws deferred from v3.0. See BUGS_FLAWS_DEBT.md FLAW-01 through FLAW-26 for full descriptions.

**Critical (v3.1 priority):**
- FLAW-04: Monetary field + currency_id pattern
- FLAW-14: Database performance (indexes, _order, store=True)
- FLAW-03: Cross-model constraint complexity
- FLAW-08: QWeb report template generation
- FLAW-19: Notification/email template generation
- FLAW-09: Dashboard/analytics view generation
- FLAW-10: HTTP controller generation

**High:**
- FLAW-01: Relationship pattern awareness (self-ref, hierarchical, through-model)
- FLAW-02: Computed field dependency chains
- FLAW-13: Bulk operation patterns (@api.model_create_multi)
- FLAW-18: Multi-level approval workflows

**Moderate:**
- FLAW-05, 06, 07, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 21, 24

**Low:**
- FLAW-17, 25, 26

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| FLAW-22: Pakistan/HEC localization | Domain-specific, not general-purpose generator concern |
| FLAW-23: Semester/academic calendar | Domain-specific educational module, use OCA school/educa |
| Agent Lightning integration | Research showed architectural mismatch — agents are markdown files, not Python runtimes |
| Cognee integration | 30+ dependency explosion for 13 KB files too small for knowledge graph |
| Intelligence Layer (Layer 5) | Deferred pending baseline metrics and training data accumulation |
