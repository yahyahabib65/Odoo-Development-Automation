## Phase Details

### Phase 26: Monetary Field Detection
**Goal**: Spec fields matching monetary patterns (amount, fee, salary, price, cost, balance) automatically become fields.Monetary with currency_id companion field injected
**Depends on**: Nothing (standalone quick win, prevents install-crashing AssertionError)
**Requirements**: SPEC-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A spec with a field named "amount" or "total_price" renders as `fields.Monetary` (not `fields.Float`) in the generated model
  2. When any field is detected as monetary, a `currency_id` Many2one to `res.currency` is auto-injected into the model if not already present
  3. The generated module installs without `AssertionError: unknown currency_field None`
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 31-01-PLAN.md — QWeb report templates, graph/pivot dashboard views, render_reports() implementation

### Phase 27: Relationship Patterns
**Goal**: Spec supports rich relationship declarations that generate through-models for M2M with extra fields, self-referential M2M with explicit relation/column params, and hierarchical parent_id with parent_path
**Depends on**: Phase 26
**Requirements**: SPEC-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A spec declaring a M2M relationship with extra fields (e.g., enrollment with grade + date) generates a dedicated through-model with the extra fields and two Many2one links
  2. A spec declaring a self-referential M2M (e.g., prerequisite courses) generates correct `relation`, `column1`, `column2` parameters to avoid ambiguous table names
  3. A spec declaring `hierarchical: true` on a model generates `parent_id`, `child_ids`, and `parent_path` fields with `_parent_name` and `_parent_store = True`
  4. Through-models get their own security ACL entries and are included in `__init__.py`
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 27-01-PLAN.md — Relationship preprocessor + template extensions for through-models, self-referential M2M, and hierarchical models



### Phase 28: Computed Chains & Cycle Detection
**Goal**: Spec supports multi-model computed field dependency chains with correct topological ordering, and rejects circular dependencies before generation
**Depends on**: Phase 27 (relationship awareness needed for cross-model references)
**Requirements**: SPEC-03, SPEC-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A spec with `computation_chains` defining fields across models generates `@api.depends` with correct dotted paths (e.g., `line_ids.subtotal`) and `store=True`
  2. Computed fields render in topologically sorted order so downstream fields reference already-defined upstream fields
  3. A spec containing a circular dependency chain (A depends on B depends on A) is rejected with an actionable error message naming the cycle participants before any files are generated
  4. The generated module with multi-model computed chains installs and computes values correctly
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 28-01-PLAN.md — Cycle detection, chain preprocessor, topological sort, and integration tests

### Phase 29: Complex Constraints
**Goal**: Spec supports cross-model validation, temporal constraints, and capacity constraints that generate create()/write() overrides with ValidationError
**Depends on**: Phase 27 (relationship patterns needed for cross-model references)
**Requirements**: SPEC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A spec with a cross-model constraint (e.g., "enrollment count cannot exceed course capacity") generates a `write()` or `create()` override that queries the related model and raises `ValidationError`
  2. A spec with a temporal constraint (e.g., "end_date must be after start_date") generates a `@api.constrains` method with the date comparison
  3. A spec with a capacity constraint (e.g., "max 30 students per section") generates validation logic that counts related records before allowing creation
  4. All generated constraint methods include proper `_()` translated error messages
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 29-01-PLAN.md — Constraint preprocessor, template extensions for temporal/cross-model/capacity constraints, unit + integration tests

### Phase 30: Scheduled Actions & Render Pipeline
**Goal**: Generator produces ir.cron XML records with model method stubs, and new render stages are wired into the renderer pipeline
**Depends on**: Phase 26 (renderer pipeline must be stable before adding stages)
**Requirements**: TMPL-05, TMPL-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A spec with `cron_jobs` entries generates `data/data.xml` containing `ir.cron` records with correct interval_type, interval_number, model_id reference, and code/method reference
  2. The target model gets an `@api.model` stub method matching the cron's method reference
  3. Generated crons default to `doall="False"` (preventing server overload on missed executions)
  4. New render stages (`render_reports`, `render_controllers`, `render_cron`) are wired into the pipeline, each returning `Result[list[Path]]` and updating manifest data
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 30-01-PLAN.md — Cron XML generation, render stage wiring, model method stubs, and pipeline expansion to 10 stages



### Phase 31: Reports & Analytics
**Goal**: Generator produces QWeb report templates with print buttons and graph/pivot dashboard views with configurable measures
**Depends on**: Phase 30 (render_reports stage must exist in pipeline)
**Requirements**: TMPL-01, TMPL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A spec with `reports` entries generates `ir.actions.report` XML, a QWeb template with `t-foreach`/`t-field` data binding, and an optional paper format record
  2. The report's form view gets a print button that triggers the report action
  3. A spec with `dashboards` or analytics entries generates graph view XML with measures/dimensions and pivot view XML with row/column/measure groupings
  4. Dashboard views are accessible via `ir.actions.act_window` with `view_mode` including `graph,pivot`
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 31-01-PLAN.md — QWeb report templates, graph/pivot dashboard views, render_reports() implementation

### Phase 32: Controllers & Import/Export
**Goal**: Generator produces HTTP controllers with secure defaults and import/export TransientModel wizards with file upload, validation, and batch processing
**Depends on**: Phase 30 (render_controllers stage must exist in pipeline)
**Requirements**: TMPL-03, TMPL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A spec with `controllers` entries generates `controllers/main.py` with `@http.route` decorators, and `controllers/__init__.py` is created and imported from the module root
  2. Generated controllers default to `auth='user'` and `csrf=True` (secure by default); JSON routes include proper error handling
  3. A spec with `import_export: true` on a model generates a TransientModel wizard with `fields.Binary` upload, row validation, preview step, and batch `_do_import()` method
  4. The import wizard validates file content type (not just extension) and the export action produces xlsx output
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 32-01-PLAN.md — HTTP controller generation with @http.route, secure defaults, JSON error handling
- [ ] 32-02-PLAN.md — Import/export TransientModel wizards with Binary upload, magic byte validation, xlsx export

### Phase 33: Database Performance
**Goal**: Generated models automatically get index=True on filterable fields, store=True on computed fields used in views, and TransientModels get cleanup configuration
**Depends on**: Phase 28 (store=True depends on computed chain awareness)
**Requirements**: PERF-01, PERF-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Fields referenced in search view filters, record rule domains, or `_order` automatically get `index=True` in the generated model
  2. Multi-field uniqueness constraints generate `_sql_constraints` entries
  3. Computed fields that appear in tree views, search filters, or `_order` automatically get `store=True`
  4. TransientModel classes get `_transient_max_hours` and `_transient_max_count` attributes
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 33-01-PLAN.md — Performance preprocessor (index, store, sql_constraints, transient cleanup) + template updates




### Phase 34: Production Patterns
**Goal**: Generated modules support bulk operations, reference data caching, and archival strategies for production-scale usage
**Depends on**: Phase 30 (archival uses cron infrastructure), Phase 33 (performance context keys)
**Requirements**: PERF-02, PERF-03, PERF-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Models with `bulk: true` in spec generate `@api.model_create_multi` on `create()` with batched post-processing
  2. Near-static reference models generate `@tools.ormcache` on lookup methods with cache invalidation in `write()` and `create()`
  3. Models with `archival: true` generate an `active` field, an archival wizard TransientModel, and an `ir.cron` scheduled action for periodic cleanup
  4. Archival crons use batch processing with commit-per-batch to avoid long transactions
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 34-01-PLAN.md — Preprocessor + model template extensions for bulk create and ORM cache patterns
- [ ] 34-02-PLAN.md — Archival wizard/cron generation with batch processing and active field injection

### Phase 35: Template Bug Fixes & Tech Debt
**Goal**: Fix critical template bugs and tech debt discovered during v3.1 milestone audit
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (archival wizard trigger_state bug), Phase 30 (cron doall hardcoding)
**Requirements**: PERF-04, TMPL-05
**Gap Closure**: Closes gaps from v3.1 audit
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A spec with `archival: true` on a model that also has a `state` Selection field renders without error — `view_form.xml.j2` guards `wizard.trigger_state` access
  2. `cron_data.xml.j2` renders `doall` from spec value instead of hardcoding `False`
  3. Regression tests cover both scenarios
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 35-01-PLAN.md — Fix view_form.xml.j2 trigger_state crash and cron_data.xml.j2 doall hardcoding
