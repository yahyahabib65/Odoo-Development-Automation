# Agentic Odoo Module Development Workflow

## What This Is

A domain-specific extension of the GSD (Get Shit Done) framework that automates Odoo 17.0 and 18.0 module development end-to-end. A developer describes a business need in natural language through their AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode), the system semantically searches GitHub and the Odoo Community Association (OCA) for similar modules, then either forks and extends a match or builds from scratch — producing OCA-grade modules through 8 coordinated AI agents with human review at 3 checkpoints.

**This is NOT a standalone CLI tool.** It is a GSD extension — agents, workflows, commands, templates, and a knowledge base that plug into GSD's orchestration layer. GSD handles context management, state persistence, hallucination prevention, phase execution, and checkpoint coordination. We build the Odoo-specific intelligence on top.

## Current State

**Shipped:** v3.0 (2026-03-05) — Bug Fixes & Tech Debt
- 25 phases total across 7 milestones, 56 plans, 325+ commits over 5 days
- AST-based auto-fix pipeline (replaced regex) with multi-line expression support
- Unified Result[T] type across entire validation pipeline
- Renderer decomposed into 7 independently testable stage functions
- Smart mail.thread injection with line item detection and tri-state chatter flag
- Docker run --rm pattern eliminates serialization race conditions
- Lazy CLI imports for fast startup
- 494 tests passing, 18,400+ LOC Python (7,178 src + 11,227 tests)
- See: `.planning/MILESTONES.md` for full history

## Core Value

Compress months of repetitive Odoo module development into days by leveraging GSD's orchestration + existing open-source modules as foundations + Odoo-specialized AI agents, so developers focus on business logic and design decisions.

## Architecture

```
Layer 1: GSD Orchestration (INHERITED — not built by us)
  - Context management, hallucination prevention
  - Phase/wave execution, state persistence
  - Checkpoint-based human review
  - Agent spawning with fresh context windows
  - Git integration, atomic commits

Layer 2: Odoo Extension (BUILT BY US)
  - Odoo-specific agents (model gen, view gen, security gen, etc.)
  - Odoo-specific workflows (module creation, validation, fork-and-extend)
  - Odoo-specific commands (/odoo-gen:new, /odoo-gen:validate, etc.)
  - Odoo knowledge base (OCA standards, Odoo 17 patterns, pylint-odoo rules)
  - Jinja2 templates for module scaffolding

Layer 3: Python Utilities (BUILT BY US)
  - Jinja2 template rendering engine
  - pylint-odoo integration
  - Docker-based Odoo 17 validation
  - ChromaDB semantic search index
  - Module structure analysis tools
  - Auto-fix pipeline (pylint + Docker error dispatch)

Layer 4: AI Coding Assistant (USER'S ENVIRONMENT)
  - Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode, etc.
  - GSD + odoo-gen extension installed
```

### Active

v3.1 — Design Flaws & Feature Gaps (not yet started)

### Out of Scope

- Web UI / browser interface — GSD extension runs inside AI coding assistants
- Mobile app — not applicable
- Standalone CLI tool — we inherit GSD's interface, not build our own
- Building our own orchestration layer — GSD provides this
- Real-time collaborative editing — single-user workflow
- Module deployment to production — system generates, human deploys
- Offline mode — requires AI coding assistant with internet access

## Context

- v3.0 shipped 2026-03-05 — Bug fixes & tech debt (14 requirements, 6 phases, 11 plans)
- v2.1 shipped 2026-03-04 — Docker auto-fix hardening, Context7 REST client, artifact state tracking
- v2.0 shipped 2026-03-04 — environment-aware generation via MCP (Phases 15-17)
- v1.2 shipped 2026-03-04 — template correctness, golden path E2E, auto-fix dispatch wiring
- v1.1 shipped 2026-03-03 — GitHub auth, dependency cleanup, live Docker testing, field string= i18n
- v1.0 shipped 2026-03-03 with 4,150 LOC Python, 243 tests, and full pipeline coverage
- Tech stack: Python 3.12, Jinja2, Click CLI, pylint-odoo, ChromaDB, Docker
- 8 specialized agents, 12 user commands, 13 knowledge base files
- Remaining: 24 design flaws deferred to v3.1, Context7 query_docs not wired into generation pipeline
- Distribution: users clone into `~/.claude/odoo-gen/` and run `install.sh`

## Constraints

- **Dependency**: Requires GSD installed (`~/.claude/get-shit-done/`)
- **Target Version**: Odoo 17.0 primary, 18.0 secondary
- **Quality Standard**: OCA-grade — pylint-odoo clean, proper i18n, full security, tests
- **Interface**: GSD commands via AI coding assistant (not standalone CLI)
- **Distribution**: Clone into `~/.claude/odoo-gen/` (like GSD)
- **Edition Support**: Both Community and Enterprise
- **Test Infrastructure**: Docker-based Odoo instances for validation
- **Build Strategy**: Search-first — check for existing modules before building from scratch
- **Human Oversight**: GSD checkpoint-based review at key generation stages
- **API Budget**: Unconstrained — prioritize quality
- **Python Utilities**: Python 3.12 (Odoo 17 constraint: 3.10-3.12 only, 3.13+ breaks validation)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| GSD extension (not standalone CLI) | GSD provides orchestration, context management, hallucination prevention | Good — inherited ~19% of requirements for free |
| Depend on GSD (not fork) | Benefit from GSD updates automatically, avoid divergence | Good — no maintenance burden |
| Clone-based install (~/.claude/) | Same pattern as GSD, works with any AI coding assistant | Good — simple setup via install.sh |
| Odoo 17.0 primary target | Stable, widely adopted, strong OCA support | Good — 18.0 added as secondary |
| Fork-and-extend strategy | Leverage existing OCA/GitHub modules as foundation | Good — ChromaDB search + companion _ext modules |
| Semantic search (ChromaDB) | Intent-based matching, not just keywords | Good — uses built-in ONNX embedding (no PyTorch) |
| Python 3.12 for utilities | Odoo 17 supports 3.10-3.12 only; 3.13+ breaks validation | Good — uv venv isolation works |
| Checkpoint-based human review | GSD provides the mechanism; we wire Odoo-specific checkpoints | Good — 3 checkpoints in generate.md |
| OCA quality as the bar | pylint-odoo, i18n, full security, tests | Good — auto-fix loops reduce manual work |
| Docker for validation | Only way to truly verify module installs and tests pass | Good — live Docker tests verify real installation |
| Jinja2 deterministic + AI enrichment | Structural files via templates, business logic via agents | Good — hybrid approach prevents hallucinations |
| Version-aware template fallback | FileSystemLoader([version_dir, shared_dir]) | Good — clean 17.0/18.0 separation |
| AST-based import analysis | More reliable than regex for complex Python imports | Good — precise unused import detection |
| Immutable read-transform-write | Read file → create new content → compare → write if changed | Good — safe auto-fix pattern |
| Configurable iteration caps (default 5) | Prevent infinite fix loops, escalate to human | Good — replaced hardcoded 2 |
| missing_import excluded from auto-dispatch | Requires human judgment (install package vs add dep) | Good — right boundary |
| Context7 stdlib-only (urllib.request) | No new deps for simple GET calls | Good — zero dependency growth |
| JSON sidecar for artifact state | .odoo-gen-state.json alongside module | Good — non-intrusive observability |
| Warning-only invalid state transitions | Log warnings but never block generation | Good — observability never interferes |
| AST-based auto-fix (not regex) | Handles multi-line expressions, complex Python syntax | Good — eliminated all regex corruption bugs |
| Result[T] unified type | Single error handling pattern across validation pipeline | Good — consistent .success/.data/.errors interface |
| Renderer decomposition (7 stages) | Each stage independently testable, under 80 lines | Good — render_module maintainable |
| Lazy CLI imports | Fast startup, heavy deps only when needed | Good — no import-time penalties |
| Docker run --rm (not exec) | Eliminates serialization race with entrypoint server | Good — reliable validation |

## Prior Art

| Project | Relevance | How we use it |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **GSD (Get Shit Done)** | INHERIT | Full orchestration layer — context, state, phases, agents, checkpoints |
| **erp_claude** (Baptiste-banani) | ADOPT KNOWLEDGE | Odoo 17 model/view skills → foundation for our knowledge base |
| **UI UX Pro Max Skill** | ADOPT PATTERN | Reasoning engine, hierarchical system, rule library → template for our skill architecture |
| **Ralph** (snarktank) | REFERENCE | Fresh context loop + accumulated knowledge pattern → confirms GSD approach |
| **Cognee** (topoteretes) | REFERENCE | Knowledge graph pipeline (cognify/memify/search) → informs knowledge base design |
| **LangExtract** (Google) | REFERENCE | Source-grounded extraction → informs spec parsing approach |
| **Agent Lightning** (Microsoft) | FUTURE | RL-based agent optimization → v2+ when we have agents to optimize |
| **Gemini-Odoo-Module-Generator** | COMPETITOR | Single-agent Gemini CLI → baseline we must exceed |
| **Personal AI Employee** (Psqasim) | ADOPT PATTERN | Odoo MCP server architecture (XML-RPC, tool definitions, safety-first) |
| **AgentFactory SDD** (Panaversity) | REFERENCE | Three SDD levels, constitution pattern — validates our existing approach |
