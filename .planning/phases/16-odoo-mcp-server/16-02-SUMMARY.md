# Phase 16 Plan 02: Claude Code MCP Configuration Summary

**.mcp.json configured with odoo-introspection server pointing to venv python, enabling Claude Code to auto-load 6 Odoo introspection tools on project open.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-04T13:33:37Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-04T13:36:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2 of 2 (both complete)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Created `.mcp.json` with odoo-introspection MCP server configuration
- Verified server starts cleanly in stdio mode (exit 124 on timeout as expected)
- Confirmed all 29 MCP unit tests pass and 350 total tests pass with no regressions
- Phase 15 dev instance defaults pre-populated as env vars (http://localhost:8069, odoo_dev, admin)
- Human verified all 6 MCP tools against live Odoo dev instance: check_connection (uid=2), list_models (account.account, res.partner, etc.), get_model_fields (field metadata with ttype), list_installed_modules (versions), check_module_dependency (sale confirmed installed), get_view_arch (real XML view architecture)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create MCP entry point and Claude Code configuration** - `8a30959` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Verify MCP server and configuration end-to-end** - human-verify checkpoint APPROVED

**Plan metadata:** Final commit included in docs commit for plan completion.

## Files Created/Modified

- `.mcp.json` - Claude Code MCP server config registering odoo-introspection server with stdio transport and Phase 15 dev instance defaults

## Decisions Made

- Used absolute venv python path (`/home/inshal-rauf/Odoo_module_automation/python/.venv/bin/python`) in the `command` field instead of bare `python`. The bare `python` command points to `/usr/bin/python` which lacks the venv packages. The venv python resolves to `/usr/bin/python3` (3.12.3) via symlink but includes all installed packages.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Used absolute venv python path instead of bare `python`**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (MCP configuration)
- **Issue:** Plan template specified `"command": "python"` but `/usr/bin/python` cannot find `odoo_gen_utils` since it's installed in the venv at `python/.venv/`. Running `timeout 2 python -m odoo_gen_utils.mcp.server` returned exit code 1 with `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- **Fix:** Used `python/.venv/bin/python` absolute path in the command field so Claude Code launches the server with the correct Python that has the venv packages.
- **Files modified:** `.mcp.json`
- **Verification:** `timeout 2 .venv/bin/python -m odoo_gen_utils.mcp.server` exits with 124 (timeout, server running), log shows "Starting Odoo MCP server (stdio transport)..."
- **Committed in:** `8a30959` (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (missing critical - wrong python path)
**Impact on plan:** Essential for correct operation. The plan's template `python` command would silently fail when Claude Code tries to launch the server.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the python path issue documented above.

## User Setup Required

**To activate the MCP server in Claude Code:**
1. Restart Claude Code in this project directory
2. The `.mcp.json` at project root is auto-loaded by Claude Code
3. The `odoo-introspection` tools will appear in the tool list
4. Start the Phase 15 Odoo dev instance: `bash scripts/odoo-dev.sh start`
5. Test with `check_connection` tool to verify live connectivity

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 16 complete: MCP server built, tested, and configured for Claude Code
- Phase 17 (Claude Code Integration) can now use the 6 Odoo introspection tools: check_connection, list_models, get_model_fields, list_installed_modules, check_module_dependency, get_view_arch
- No blockers identified
