# Phase 4 Plan 2: Approval Flow & Spec Rendering Summary

**Complete Phase 4 approval flow with markdown summary rendering from spec.json, three-option user review, and git commit on approval**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-02T02:10:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-02T02:14:56Z
- **Tasks:** 2/2 (1 auto + 1 checkpoint -- approved)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Replaced Phase 4 placeholder in `workflows/spec.md` with complete 199-line implementation growing the file from ~445 to ~560 lines
- Implemented Step 4.1 (markdown summary rendering from spec.json) with all sections: Overview, Dependencies, Models, Relationships, Views, Security Groups, Workflow States, Menu Structure, Demo Data, Inferred Defaults
- Implemented Step 4.2 (user review presentation) with three options: Approve, Request Changes, Edit Directly
- Implemented Step 4.3 (response handling) with targeted follow-up questions on changes and spec re-rendering loop
- Added Step 4.4 (iteration limit advisory after 3 rounds) and Step 4.5 (error handling for file/git failures)
- Added Key Rules section enforcing JSON-first rendering, approval gate, and backward compatibility

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Implement approval flow in spec workflow Phase 4** - `c2fcf12` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `workflows/spec.md` - Complete Phase 4 implementation added (~155 lines inserted, ~36 lines replaced)

## Decisions Made
- JSON-first rendering: generate spec.json first, then derive the markdown summary from it (prevents desync)
- Approval gate is a hard block: no downstream generation begins until user explicitly approves
- On "Request Changes", system asks 1-3 targeted questions about only the sections flagged by the user
- 3-round iteration limit is advisory, not a hard stop -- user can continue if changes are minor
- Error handling covers file write failures (suggest manual mkdir) and git commit failures (spec still saved locally)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 4 specification workflow is now fully complete (all 4 phases implemented)
- INPT-04 requirement complete -- user approved the specification workflow
- Phase 4 is fully done (2/2 plans complete)
- Phase 5 (Core Code Generation) is now unblocked and ready for planning

## Checkpoint: Approved

**Task 2 (checkpoint:human-verify):** User approved the complete specification workflow.
- All 4 phases verified: NL parsing, tiered follow-up, structured spec, approval flow
- Approval flow confirmed: Approve / Request Changes / Edit Directly options present
- spec.json rendering, git commit on approval, and inferred defaults section verified
- INPT-04 requirement satisfied

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files verified present. Commit hash c2fcf12 verified in git log. Checkpoint approved by user.
