# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Compress months of repetitive Odoo module development into days by extending GSD's orchestration with Odoo-specialized agents, knowledge, and validation.
**Architecture:** GSD extension (not standalone CLI)
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - GSD Extension + Odoo Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (GSD Extension + Odoo Foundation) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4 complete
Status: Phase 1 Complete -- ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-03-01 -- Completed 01-04 (Scaffold Workflows + E2E Integration)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | 13 min | 3.25 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01, 01-02 (3 min), 01-03 (3 min), 01-04 (4 min)
- Trend: Consistent

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Architecture]: odoo-gen is a GSD extension, not a standalone CLI tool
- [Architecture]: Depend on GSD (not fork) — benefit from upstream updates
- [Architecture]: Clone-based install into ~/.claude/odoo-gen/
- [Architecture]: UI UX Pro Max Skill pattern for reasoning engine + rule library
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is GSD extension setup + Odoo foundation (not CLI build)
- [Roadmap]: Knowledge Base moved to Phase 2 (before validation, so agents have expertise)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 can run in parallel after Phase 1
- [Roadmap]: Old standalone CLI plans deleted — wrong architecture
- [Commands]: Forward reference to scaffold.md in new.md (resolved at invocation time)
- [Commands]: help.md uses inline command table (self-contained, no external workflow)
- [Templates]: Combined form+tree+search views into single per-model view file for render_module
- [Templates]: Single menu.xml for all models (cleaner OCA structure)
- [Package]: Hatchling build backend for pyproject.toml-native packaging
- [Agents]: Symlinks for agent registration (ln -sf) instead of copy -- keeps agents in extension dir
- [Agents]: odoo-scaffold agent includes comprehensive Odoo 17.0 specifics to prevent LLM hallucinations
- [Security]: defaults.json api_keys uses $ENV_VAR references resolved at runtime -- never stores secrets
- [Infra]: Wrapper script at bin/odoo-gen-utils resolves venv path portably across platforms
- [Workflows]: Scaffold workflow defines 4 phases: input parsing, spec confirmation, generation (odoo-gen-utils), post-generation
- [Workflows]: Help workflow uses inline table with Active/Planned status labels
- [Templates]: Chatter section in form views conditional on 'mail' in depends

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- gh CLI not authenticated -- needed for Phase 8 (GitHub API search). Not blocking until then.
- sentence-transformers pulls PyTorch (~2GB) -- plan CPU-only install strategy for Phase 8.
- GSD must be installed as prerequisite -- document in setup instructions.
