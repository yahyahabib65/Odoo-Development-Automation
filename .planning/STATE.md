# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Compress months of repetitive Odoo module development into days by extending GSD's orchestration with Odoo-specialized agents, knowledge, and validation.
**Architecture:** GSD extension (not standalone CLI)
**Current focus:** v1.1 Tech Debt Cleanup — Phase 11 in progress (02/02 plans done)

## Current Position

Phase: 11 - Live Integration Testing & i18n
Plan: 2/2 plans complete (11-01 + 11-02)
Status: Phase 11 plan 02 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Completed 11-02-PLAN.md (i18n field string= AST extraction)

## Decisions

- Wizard outputs to stderr (err=True) so stdout remains clean for piping
- extend-module gets auth check before cloning (was missing pre-existing)
- format_auth_guidance returns static strings based on AuthStatus fields
- Removed sentence-transformers and torch from [search] extras -- ChromaDB uses built-in ONNX embedding, saving ~200MB
- Used module-level pytestmark for e2e marker instead of per-test decorators
- Session-scoped e2e_index_db fixture in test_e2e_github.py, module-scoped in test_e2e_index.py
- Used if/elif in AST walker to prevent a Call node matching both _() and fields.*() patterns simultaneously
- Added norecursedirs to pyproject.toml to exclude docker fixture module (imports odoo at load time) from pytest collection
- Added fixtures/conftest.py with collect_ignore_glob to prevent pytest Odoo import errors (cleaner than norecursedirs)
- Fixture model fields all include string= attributes to serve dual-purpose for both Docker and i18n testing

## Performance Metrics
