# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Compress months of repetitive Odoo module development into days by extending GSD's orchestration with Odoo-specialized agents, knowledge, and validation.
**Architecture:** GSD extension (not standalone CLI)
**Current focus:** v2.0 Phase 15 — Odoo Dev Instance

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.0 Environment-Aware Generation
Phase: 15 of 19 (Odoo Dev Instance)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 15 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-04 — Plan 15-02 executed (dev instance unit + Docker integration tests)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Key Decisions (v2.0)

- Version: v2.0 (major architectural shift, not incremental)
- MCP structure: Integrated into odoo-gen codebase (not standalone)
- Odoo dev instance: Docker Compose with Odoo 17 CE + PostgreSQL
- Scope: 5 requirements across 3 phases (Phases 15-17); 4 requirements deferred to v2.1 (Phases 18-19)
- Branching: Per milestone (gsd/v2.0-environment-aware-generation)
- Phases 18-19 deferred to v2.1 (auto-fix hardening + enhancements)
- Python3 urllib for healthcheck instead of curl (curl may not be in official Odoo image)
- docker compose run --rm for module init (not exec, avoids serialization failures)
- Separate docker/dev/ directory to avoid conflicts with existing validation compose
- Unit tests validate config files directly (no Docker needed) for fast CI feedback
- Docker integration tests use class-scoped fixture to share one startup cycle
- Fixture teardown uses stop (not reset) to preserve data between test runs

## Blockers/Concerns
