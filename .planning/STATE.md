# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Compress months of repetitive Odoo module development into days by extending GSD's orchestration with Odoo-specialized agents, knowledge, and validation.
**Architecture:** GSD extension (not standalone CLI)
**Current focus:** v3.1 Phase 30 — Scheduled Actions & Render Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 30 of 34 (Scheduled Actions & Render Pipeline)
Plan: 01 of 01 (complete)
Status: Plan 01 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-06 — Phase 30 Plan 01 executed

Progress: [██████░░░░] 56%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 56 (across all milestones)
- Average duration: ~25 min
- Total execution time: ~23 hours

**Recent Trend (v3.0):**
- 11 plans across 6 phases in 1 day
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v3.1 scope: 16 requirements across 3 categories (Spec Design 5, Template Generation 6, Performance 5)
- Phase ordering: Spec design first (foundation), then templates (new artifacts), then performance (production-readiness)
- SPEC-01 (Monetary) is standalone quick win, placed first
- SPEC-03 + SPEC-05 paired (chains + cycle detection are natural fit)
- TMPL-05 (cron) before PERF-04 (archival) since archival uses cron
- Deferred to v3.2+: Security, Business Logic, Domain/Localization, Tooling, Architecture
- [Phase 26]: Monetary branch placed before compute branch in templates; 20 keyword patterns for financial field detection; opt-out via monetary:false
- [Phase 27]: Through-model FK names from model last part; self-M2M relation table named {model_table}_{field_name}_rel; hierarchical detection in _build_model_context(); view_fields excludes internal fields
- [Phase 27]: Through-model FK names from model last part; self-M2M relation table {model_table}_{field_name}_rel; hierarchical in _build_model_context(); view_fields excludes internal fields
- [Phase 28]: graphlib.TopologicalSorter for cycle detection + field ordering; cycle validation runs first in render_module(); chain preprocessor is pure function (immutability); computation_chains enriches fields with depends/store/compute
- [Phase 29]: Temporal constraints use @api.constrains (same-record); cross_model/capacity use create()/write() overrides (Odoo ignores dotted names in @api.constrains); single override per model with multiple _check_* calls; all messages in _() for i18n
- [Phase 30]: Cron stages placed after render_static (8-10); method name validation via str.isidentifier(); render_reports/render_controllers are Result.ok([]) placeholders for Phase 31/32

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- AskUserQuestion tool is unreliable — use plain text questions instead.
- Research flag: QWeb report wkhtmltopdf quirks need hands-on testing (Phase 31)
- Research flag: openpyxl integration pattern has several moving parts (Phase 32)
- Research flag: Odoo 18.0 declarative Index API may need version-specific template (Phase 33)
