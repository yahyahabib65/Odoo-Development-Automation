# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Compress months of repetitive Odoo module development into days by extending GSD's orchestration with Odoo-specialized agents, knowledge, and validation.
**Architecture:** GSD extension (not standalone CLI)
**Current focus:** v1.2 Template Quality -- Phase 12: Template Correctness & Auto-Fix

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 13 (Template Correctness & Auto-Fix)
Plan: 2 of 2 complete
Status: Phase 12 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-03 -- Completed 12-02 auto-fix and knowledge base

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2 (v1.2)
- Average duration: 4.5min
- Total execution time: 9min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 12 | 2 | 9min | 4.5min |

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### From v1.1
- Wizard outputs to stderr (err=True) so stdout remains clean for piping
- extend-module gets auth check before cloning (was missing pre-existing)
- format_auth_guidance returns static strings based on AuthStatus fields
- Removed sentence-transformers and torch from [search] extras -- ChromaDB uses built-in ONNX embedding, saving ~200MB
- Used module-level pytestmark for e2e marker instead of per-test decorators
- Used if/elif in AST walker to prevent a Call node matching both _() and fields.*() patterns simultaneously
- Added fixtures/conftest.py with collect_ignore_glob to prevent pytest Odoo import errors
- Fixture model fields all include string= attributes to serve dual-purpose for both Docker and i18n testing
- Docker `exec` into running Odoo container causes serialization failures -- use `run --rm` instead
- `--test-tags={module}` required to avoid running 938+ base tests
- Odoo 17 test log format: `Starting ClassName.test_method ...` (not `test_method ... ok`)

### Decisions

- inherit_list uses ordered list so explicit inherit appears first, mail mixins after (12-01)
- needs_api computed from existing context vars rather than inline template logic (12-01)
- [Phase 12]: Used AST parsing for import analysis rather than pure regex
- [Phase 12]: Targeted unused import detection at known template patterns (api, ValidationError) rather than general-purpose analyzer

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
